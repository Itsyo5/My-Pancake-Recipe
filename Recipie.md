The Steps to make Pancakes are as follows:

Take a small bowl, put flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into it, mix it just a little bit for a little while.

Put the eggs and milk into the dry mixture.

Mix the batter just until it has a smooth consistency.

Pour the batter by 1/2 cupfulls onto a greased hot pan. Flip it when bubbles form on top of the pancake; cook it until both the sides are golden brown.

AND VOILA! You have yourself a plateful of incredibly delicious pancakes. And that too, MADE BY YOURSELF!
